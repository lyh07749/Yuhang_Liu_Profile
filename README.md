### Thesis Topic: Estimating the Effectiveness of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) During COVID-19

Worldwide, governments imposed a wide range of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Three years later today, pandemic fatigue has set in among the worldâ€™s population as the virus attack continues in waves. To help governments contain the pandemic more effectively and to ease the burden on the population, we examined the effectiveness of individual NPI among the 42 states in the US where death count exceeded 100 during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (February 1 to June 15, 2020). Two types of analyses were performed. Firstly, a prototypical Bayesian hierarchical model is employed to estimate the effectiveness of 5 commonly imposed NPIs in the US, including *gathering restriction*, *restaurant capacity restriction*, *business closure*, *school closure*, and *stay-at-home*. Secondly, the effectiveness of *facemask mandate*, the most controversial policy among states, is studied through counterfactual modeling, a variant of the prototypical Bayesian hierarchical model.
