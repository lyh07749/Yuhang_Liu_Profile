### Thesis Topic: Estimating the Effectiveness of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) During COVID-19

Worldwide, governments imposed a wide range of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Three years later today, pandemic fatigue has set in among the worldâ€™s population as the virus attack continues in waves. To help governments contain the pandemic more effectively and to ease the burden on the population, we examined the effectiveness of individual NPI among the 42 states in the US where death count exceeded 100 during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (February 1 to June 15, 2020). Two types of analyses were performed. Firstly, a prototypical Bayesian hierarchical model is employed to estimate the effectiveness of 5 commonly imposed NPIs in the US, including *gathering restriction*, *restaurant capacity restriction*, *business closure*, *school closure*, and *stay-at-home*. Secondly, the effectiveness of *facemask mandate*, the most controversial policy among states, is studied through counterfactual modeling, a variant of the prototypical Bayesian hierarchical model.

The colored states are the 42 states whose death count had exceeded 100 by the end of the study period where the grey states were the ones excluded from the analysis due to low death count.The 14 green states implemented facemask mandate policy during the study period where the 28 pink states did not implement facemask mandate policy during the study period.

### Project 1: COVID-19 Survival Model Comparasion

**Study Period:** March 2020 to December 2020

**Data:** the patient-level data originated from Stony Brook Medicine and were received in raw as csv files. 
* The **first raw EMR data file (dim: 3535 * 168)** contains the patient demographics data, including but not limited to mrn, encounter number, admission date, discharge date, age, gender, race, ethnicity, symtoms (cough, sore throat, etc.), pre-exisisting conditions (heart failure, COPD, CHD, etc.), and patient vital status. Most of the patients have only one encounter during the study period, but there's still some patients have multiple encounters. If this is the case, we select the most recent COVID-19 related encounter.
* The **second raw EMR data file (dim: 1048571 * 10)** contains 26 measured biomarkers, including but not limited to ALT, AST, Creatinine, C-Reactive Protein, etc. The lab will only measure the biomarkers which the physician considered necessary for the patient. The physician may start/stop asking measure a particular biomarker at any time during a patient's hospital stay. If necessary, one biomarker might being measured multiple times for the same patient within the same day.

**Models Implemented:**
* Cox Proportional Hazard Model
* Random Survival Forest
* Survival Tree
* Conditional Inference Forest

**Result Visulizations (generated using ggplot in R):** will be updated after journal publication.

### Project 2: Patient Self-Report Superior to Electronic Medical Record Abstraction for Identifying Positive COVID-19 Symptoms at Illness Onset [(Published)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2773065422000049)

**Study Period:** Feburary 2020 to August 2020

**Data:** the received **survey data (dim: 316 * 1219)** was collected from patient telephone interviews and electronic medical record (EMR) abstraction. Potential risk factors assessed included participant demographics, medical comorbidities, and number and type of symptoms at illness onset. Outcome measures included symptom duration, hospitalizations, and persistence of symptoms at 12 weeks from study enrollment.

**Statistical Analysis:** Patient characteristics were described using medians (range) and frequencies (percentages) when appropriate. Percentages of pre-existing medical comorbidities, number of symptoms at onset of illness, COVID-19 testing, and escalating medical care were calculated. Percentages of each individual symptom were calculated at onset of illness and at 12 week follow up. To evaluate the association of risk factors with hospitalization (ever vs. never) and symptom chronicity (persistent vs. resolved), **univariable and multivariable analyses** were performed.  To evaluate for association of risk factors with duration of symptoms, **Spearman correlation** was used. For univariable analyses, **Chi-square tests** were used for categorical risk factors (e.g. medical comorbidities, travel history). **Wilcoxon rank sum tests** were used for numeric risk factors (e.g. number of symptoms at illness onset). For multivariable analyses, hospitalization (ever vs never) and symptom resolved status (persistent vs resolved) were analyzed as the outcomes in **logistic regression**. Explanatory variables included number of symptoms, presence of 5 key signs, symptoms at onset of illness, medical comorbidities, history of travel and demographic characteristics (i.e. age, gender and race). 

**Result Highlights:**
* Nearly 1/5 of patients with COVID-19 had no pre-existing medical conditions
* Patients self-reported nearly twice as many symptoms as recorded in medical records
* More symptoms at illness onset was associated with symptom duration and chronicity
